### Customizing Themes

See this [link](https://github.com/SpongeBobSun/Prodigal/blob/master/Themes.md) for customizing themes.



### Building

To build Prodigal for Android you need import the project in AndroidStudio.

Before you hit the run or debug button, you may need to run the `zipThemes` gradle task, which will zip the theme folder and copy it to `assets` folder.

After themes are zipped as assets, you can switch to the `app` configuration and hit the run button.

### Pillar of Shame

You can take my source & add ADs to it then pretent it's your own APP but this is NOT cool.

If you want to do it anyway, you MUST distribute a copy of Apache license and copyright notice along with your software.

Or I WILL add your work to this pillar of shame.
